## Sorting 

In this release we introduce the possibility for your users to sort documents based on their
preferences. 

Documents can be sorted based on name, last modified date, creation date and language within My uploads, Recent, Starred and within Collections. Shared documents can also be sorted by date and user.

Sorting works also when performing a search, although limited to document fields like name, last modified date and language.

Sorting options are visible in the column headers if using the detail view, and in a specific sorting menu on all other visualizations.


## Other improvements


- Add ability to star a document from details panels
- Add language selector under the profile menu
- Fix highlighted document or collection not in visible area
- Fix documents in collection not reindexed after move
- Support markdown in project description
